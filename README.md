## Running Locally

### Create an Sanity application

Go to [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) to create an application and pass key to environments `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`

### Environment variables

Set up environment variables following `.env.example`

### Running

This application requires Node.js v18.17+.

```bash
bun install
bun run setup # Remove all of my personal information
bun dev
```

Create a `.env.local` file similar to `.env.example`

## Sanity

Navigate to `/studio` to log in to your Sanity account, where you can access and edit content once you've signed up.

Updates made to your site would be triggered only on build time â†’ If you update a field in your studio using the hosted link, you would have to manually trigger a deployment on Vercel to see the changes.

We have 2 solution: 
- Following https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-portfolio-site-with-sanity-and-nextjs/ to trigger deploy Vercel when update document in studio

- [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration), which is a better option if you're building a large scale application.

I choose ISR for this project about every hour 

### What's ISR ?

When a request is made to a page that was pre-rendered at build time, it will initially show the cached page.

- Any requests to the page after the initial request and before 10 seconds are also cached and instantaneous.

- After the 10-second window, the next request will still show the cached (stale) page

- Next.js triggers a regeneration of the page in the background.

- Once the page generates successfully, Next.js will invalidate the cache and show the updated page. If the background regeneration fails, the old page would still be unaltered.

## NextAuth

All requests to /api/auth/* (signIn, callback, signOut, etc.) will automatically be handled by NextAuth.js.
